# Unity-Photon-Online-Test-Game-2021
Online game made with Unity and Photon for Develompent for Networks assignment.
Small project made to learn development for network games.

The game objective is to defeat all the enemy players to win.

It connects to a Photon Server, it's a free suscription so no more than 5 clients can connect.
The first one to join a room will act as a server (the server doesn't count as a player) and the other 4 will be clients/players.

You can set your nickname, create and join rooms using room names.
When inside a room you have a chat to communicate with other players while waiting for the game to start.
When 4 players are inside a room, the game will start.
